### IT Manifesto

<img src="https://itjumpstart.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/isaiah-scroll-l.jpg">

Instead of talking about microservices, just say push-based services.

Instead of talking about RPC, just say pull-based services.

Instead of talking about Agile, just say ["anything goes"](http://programming-motherfucker.com/).

Instead of talking about thought leaders, just say diversity of perspectives.

Instead of talking about [scalable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iquZl-CUR_U), just say [awesome](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24737268-badass).

Instead of talking about DevOps, just say [Dev/Ops](https://medium.com/p/dev-ops-not-devops-dc1123fccd97).

Instead of talking, put up or shut up.

We have more important things to do than squabble about things on the left.

But as always, you canâ€™t please everyone.
