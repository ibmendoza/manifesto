### IT Manifesto

<img src="https://itjumpstart.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/isaiah-scroll-l.jpg">

Instead of talking about microservices, just say push-based services.

Instead of talking about RPC, just say pull-based services.

Instead of talking about Agile, just say “anything goes”.

Instead of talking about thought leaders, just say trolls.

Instead of talking about scalable, just say awesome.

Instead of talking about DevOps, just say Dev/Ops.

Instead of talking, put up or shut up.

We have more important things to do than squabble about things on the left.

But as always, you can’t please everyone.
